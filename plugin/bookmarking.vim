"     Summary: A bookmaking facility to Vim for marking points of interest.
"
" GetLatestVimScripts: 3022 1 :AutoInstall: bookmarking.vim
"
" Description:
" Add a book marking feature to Vim that allows lines of interest to be marked.
" While similar to marks, you don't need to assign a bookmark to a mark key,
" instead an infinite number of bookmarks can be created and then jumped
" through in sequential order (by line number) with no strain on your memory.
" This is great to use when you are browsing through some source code for the
" first time and need to mark out places of interest to learn how it works.
"
" Installation:
" Normally, this file will reside in your plugins directory and be
" automatically sourced. No changes to your .vimrc are needed unless you want
" to change some default settings.
"
" Uses:
" The bookmark facility provides a number of new commands as well as a default
" mapping of these commands to keys. This mapping can be customised as can the
" bookmarks appearance.
"
" Commands available (with keyboard shortcuts in brackets):
"  * Use the command 'ToggleBookmark' to set or remove a bookmark. (<F3>)
"  * Use the command 'NextBookmark' to jump to the next bookmark. (<F4>)
"  * Use the command 'PreviousBookmark' to jump to the previous bookmark. (<F5>)
"
" Settings:
" The keyboard mapping of the commands can be easily changed by adding new
" mappings to them in your .vimrc. If a mapping is defined in your .vimrc
" then the default mappings won't be added.
"
" You can also alter the appearance of the bookmark itself. The bookmark is
" shown on the screen using Vim's sign feature. To define the sign used for a
" bookmark yourself, include a sign definition in your .vimrc for a sign
" called 'bookmark'.
"
" Finally you can control if a menu item is created for the bookmarking plugin
" using the 'g:bookmarking_menu' global variable. Setting this to 1 will mean
" the menu is created, which is the default. Setting it to 0 will mean the
" menu isn't created.
"
" Examples:
" In your .vimrc:
"
"     map <silent> bb :ToggleBookmark<CR>
"     map <silent> bn :NextBookmark<CR>
"     map <silent> bp :PreviousBookmark<CR>
"
"     let g:bookmarking_menu = 1
"
"     define bookmark text=>>
"
" History:
"   Wed Dec 21, 2011 - 2.3:
"     * Fix bookmarking to work even if signs feature not enabled
"
"   Wed Nov 16, 2011 - 2.2:
"     * Add 'g:bookmarking_menu' global to control if menu is created
"
"   Wed Jul 6, 2010 - 2.1:
"     * Fixed bug where the script only worked for files with a '.' in their
"       names
"
"   Wed Jul 6, 2010 - 2.0:
"     * Huge amount of bugs fixed, previous version was pretty broken.
"     * Added new ClearBookmarks command, to clear all bookmarks.
"
"   Fri Mar 19, 2010 - 1.0:
"     * Initial release.
